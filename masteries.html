            <h2>Masteries</h2>
            <img src="Masteries.png" width="91%"> 
            <p>A mastery is an option for bonus stats and/or special atributes. There are currently 45 masteries organized into 3 skill trees:<span style="color: #ff2929">Ferocity</span>, <span style="color: #3030ff">Cunning</span> and <span style="color: lawngreen">Resolve</span> (respectively). Each tree culminates in 3 extra-inpactful <span style="color: yellow">Keystone Masteries</span>(Masteries at the bottom of the three trees).</p>
            <p>The mastery points maximum cap is 30, which is also the level cap.It takes 18 points to reach a keystone, sice some masteries need 5 points to unlock its full potencial, leaving 12 to use among the remaining trees. As said before, mastery points are earned by <span style="color: #8b8bff">leveling up</span> your account.</p>
            <p>Every player has the opportunity to create 20 different mastery pages that can be edited during champion selection or in your summoner profile.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When selecting you masteries you must pay attention to what role your playing, what champion your using and the playstyle you want to pursue.If you intend to deal tons of damage then it's best to choose either from the <span style="color #ff2929">Ferocity</span> tree or the <span style="color: #3030ff">Cunning</span> one, since they offer a lot of offensive stats and adaptive bonuses. Durability-focused champions tend to pick their <span style="color yellow">Keystone</span> from the <span style="color: lawngreen">Resolve</span> tree given their defensive stats. Most supportive champions work well with both the <span style="color: #3030ff">Cunning</span> tree and the <span style="color: lawngreen">Resolve</span> one.</p>
            <p>Although for each champion there might be a general one way route, you should adapt your masteries for each game, since each game is completly different given the wide variety of possibilities and courses a match could take.</p>
