            <h2>Introduction</h2><!-- introdução ao guia -->
            <p>Welcome to our League of Legends guide.</p>
            <p>Our goal is to explain, very simply, the complexity of the game and how it's played, and we hope that our guide can help you grow into a competent and competitive player.</p>
            <p>Although our guide will be fairly big, you'll have to experience all the theory in-game, and the best way to do it is indubitably by playing.</p><br />

            <h2>What's "League of Legends"?</h2>
            <p>League of Legends is a video game belonging to the MOBA genre, or <em>Multiplayer Online Battle Arena</em>. It was created by Riot Games (or Rito, as players sometimes call it) back in 2009, and has since become one of the most played online game of all time.</p>
            <p>Players are divided into 2 teams of 5, that fight to destroy the enemy's Nexus, an infrastructure located in the center of each team's base.</p>
            <p>At the beggining of each new match, players choose from 134 Champions (if owned) and costumize it with <a class="nav" target="_blank" href="masteries.html">Masteries</a> and <a class="nav" target="_blank" href="runes.html">Runes</a>.</p>

            <h2>Accounts</h2>
            <p>At the beginning, every <u>Summoner</u> (Player) starts at level 1 and progresses up to level 30 by simply playing the game. That is, at the end of every game, players receive a certain amount of <em>XP</em> (Experience Points), gaining levels which in turn gives other rewards (but we'll talk about them later on).</p>
            <p>There are two types of currency in League of Legends, such being <b>IP</b> and <b>RP</b>. <b>IP</b> (Influence Points) is earned just like XP, after each match, and is used to buy various content in the shop, such as Champions and Runes. <b>RP</b> (Riot Points) is a currency purchased with real money and can be used to buy almost anything (even Champions), but it's mostly used to purchase cosmetic features (Champion Skins) that can only be bought with this currency.</p>
